## Navigation Best Practices

### Mobile Navigation
- Hamburger menu for screens < 768px
- Touch-friendly tap targets (min 44px)
- Collapsible dropdown menus
- Swipe gestures for mobile navigation

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support (Tab, Enter, Esc)
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Skip navigation link
- Clear focus indicators
- Sufficient color contrast

### User Experience
- Maximum 2 levels of dropdown depth
- Highlight active page
- Breadcrumb navigation on deep pages
- Search functionality (Phase 2+)
- Consistent menu placement across pages

## Conclusion

This comparison demonstrates the evolution from a simple 6-page informational website to a comprehensive educational portal. The phased approach ensures:

1. **Immediate Value**: Phase 1 adds critical missing pages (Admissions, Student Life, News, Parents)
2. **Manageable Growth**: Each phase builds on the previous
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Start with static, move to dynamic as needed
4. **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Progressive enhancement of features

**Next Step**: Begin Phase 1 implementation starting with the Admissions page.
