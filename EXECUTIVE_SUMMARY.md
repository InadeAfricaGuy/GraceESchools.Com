## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can we skip directly to Phase 3 for the portals?
**A**: Not recommended. Building a solid content foundation (Phase 1) and dynamic capabilities (Phase 2) first ensures better user experience and easier maintenance.

### Q: What if we can't afford all phases?
**A**: Phase 1 alone provides significant value with minimal cost. Each phase stands on its own and can be implemented independently.

### Q: How much technical knowledge do we need?
**A**: Phase 1 requires basic web development. Phases 2-4 need experienced developers, but we provide detailed specifications to guide the work.

### Q: Can we use free or cheaper alternatives?
**A**: Yes! Phase 1 can be free (GitHub Pages hosting). Phase 2 can use free CMS options. Higher phases require paid services but can be optimized for cost.

### Q: How long until parents can pay fees online?
**A**: Online payment comes in Phase 4, approximately 12-18 months from start. However, Phase 1 provides fee information to help parents prepare.

### Q: Will the current website remain functional?
**A**: Yes! We enhance the existing site progressively. The current pages stay accessible throughout all phases.
