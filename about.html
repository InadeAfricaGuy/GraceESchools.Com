            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Grace E. Schools was founded in 1968 by Deaconess Mrs. Grace Bisola Oshinowo with a vision to provide quality education that nurtures the whole child - academically, morally, and spiritually. What began as Grace Children School has grown into a comprehensive educational institution serving students from infancy through secondary education.</p>
            <p>In 1994, Grace High School was established to extend our commitment to excellence into the secondary education level. Today, Grace E. Schools stands as one of the most respected private educational institutions in Lagos, Nigeria, with a proud tradition of producing graduates who excel both nationally and internationally.</p>
